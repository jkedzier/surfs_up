I have prepared an analysis between June and December for the shop to ensure that there is favorable weather all year long.  This will give us a sense of seasonality.  To do this, I gathered general statistics for from all June Days and DecemberDays.  I have attached the notebook for your review.

## Findings
In comparing stats for July and December, I see the following
1-December is a few degrees cooler throughout.  June ranges from 64-85 with a mean of 75, but December ranges from 69-83, but the mean is 71, meaning the temperature ranges lower.
2-December temperatures have a wider range of variability, with a larger standard deviation of 3.7 degrees and .54 inches of rain, compared with 3.2 degrees and .33 inches of rain.
3-December has more total rain and heavier rain with a max of 6.42 inches vs 4.43 inches of rain in June.  Average rainfall in june is .13, but December has .21, nearly 50% more rain.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis
Along seasonality of temperature and precipitation, I would recommend the following:
1-Seasonality of humidity - Ice Cream and beach weather become highly sought after when it is humid out.
2-Length of Day/Sunshine.  This business will thrive when there are longer days with more sunshine
3-Seasonality of non-weather metrics, such as # Visitors to get a sense of when there will be major spikes in visits to our business
