I have prepared an analysis between June and December for the shop to ensure that there is favorable weather all year long.  This will give us a sense of seasonality.  To do this, I gathered general statistics for from all June Days and DecemberDays.  I have attached the notebook for your review.

##Findings


##Recommendations for Further Analysis
Along seasonality of temperature and precipitation, I would recommend the following:
1-Seasonality of humidity - Ice Cream and beach weather become highly sought after when it is humid out.
2-Length of Day/Sunshine.  This business will thrive when there are longer days with more sunshine
3-Seasonality of non-weather metrics, such as # Visitors to get a sense of when there will be major spikes in visits to our business
